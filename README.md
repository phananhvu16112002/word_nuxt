Introduction to Nuxt
Chapter 1: Introduction to Nuxt
Slide 1: What is Nuxt?
Nuxt is an open-source JavaScript framework based on Vue.js. The latest version is Nuxt 3, an upgrade built on Vite, Vue 3, and Nitro, with support from TypeScript.

Nuxt simplifies the deployment of websites using SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation), in addition to CSR, ISR, ESR, and SWR. It provides a structured and convention-based approach to building VueJS applications, allowing developers to focus on feature development without complex configuration.

SSR (Server-Side Rendering): Improves SEO and page load speed.
"One of the strengths of Nuxt 3 is server-side rendering (SSR), which means our web pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the user, enhancing page load speed and SEO."
SSG (Static Site Generation): Quickly and securely generates static web pages.
"Nuxt 3 supports static site generation (SSG), useful for building fast, secure web pages that are easy to deploy on static platforms."
